# Package Stats Client

This project is currently using [terezka/line-charts](https://github.com/terezka/line-charts), which is currently not published to the elm package index. THerefore, you'll need to use [`elm-install`](https://github.com/gdotdesign/elm-github-install) to install deps. Install globally via npm or yarn (`npm install -g elm-install` or `yarn global add elm-install`) then run `elm-install` to install deps.

Once line-charts is published, it should get picked up automatically by `elm-package install` assuming the package name is correct.
